# Windows Shutdown Timer
Fed up with leaving your PC on all night waiting for a download to finish ? No.... well anyway this is just a small program that will
allow you to choose a certain amount of time before it automatically turns the pc off. So if your download is estimted to take 3 hours,
then just set the timer to just over 3 hours to be safe and it will turn off.
